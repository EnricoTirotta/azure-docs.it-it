## <a name="obtaining-subscription-keys"></a>Obtaining Subscription Keys
Every call to the Computer Vision API requires a subscription key. This key needs to be either passed through a query string parameter or specified in the request header. 

To sign up for subscription keys, see [Subscriptions](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up). It's free to sign up. Pricing for these services is subject to change. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Free subscriptions that are not used for 90 days consecutively may expire. However, if your subscription expires you can request new keys.

## <a name="obtaining-subscription-keys"></a>Obtaining Subscription Keys
Every call to the Computer Vision API requires a subscription key. This key needs to be either passed through a query string parameter or specified in the request header. 

To sign up for subscription keys, see [Subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/). It's free to sign up. Pricing for these services is subject to change.

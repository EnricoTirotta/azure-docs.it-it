You can collaborate with others and work on your LUIS app at the same time. 

To allow collaborators to edit your LUIS app, in the **Collaborators** section of in your **My Apps** page, enter the email of the collaborator and click **Add collaborator**.

* Collaborators can sign in and edit your LUIS app as the same time as you. If a collaborator edits the LUIS app by adding an intent or entity or labeling an utterance, you'll see a notication.

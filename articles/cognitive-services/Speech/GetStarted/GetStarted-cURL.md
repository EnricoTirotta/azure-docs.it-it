# <a name="get-started-with-speech-rest-api-in-curl"></a>Get Started with Speech REST API in cURL

Exercise Bing Speech Recognition API using cURL to convert spoken audio to text by sending audio to Microsoftâ€™s servers in the cloud. The example below is **bash** commands that demonstrates the use of Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford) Speech To Text API using **cURL**.

The Speech Recognition web example demonstrates the following features using a wav file or external microphone input:
 * Access token generation
 * Short-form recognition This example assumes that **cURL** is available in your bash environment.

## <a name="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
* #### <a name="platform-requirements"></a>Platform requirements
The below example has been developed in **bash**. (Also works in git bash/zsh/etc)

* #### <a name="subscribe-to-speech-api-and-get-a-free-trial-subscription-key"></a>Subscribe to Speech API and get a free trial subscription key
Before creating the example, you must subscribe to Speech API which is part of Microsoft Cognitive Services. For subscription and key management details, see [Subscriptions](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up). Both the primary and secondary key can be used in this tutorial.

## <a name="Step1"></a>Step 1: Generate an Access Token
1.    Replace **your_subscription_key** with your own subscription key and run the command in **bash**.

    `curl -v -X POST "https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0/issueToken" -H "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -H "Content-Length: 0" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: your_subscription_key"`

2.    The response is a string with the JSON Web Token (JWT) access token.
    `JWT access token`

## <a name="Step2"></a>Step 2: Upload the Audio Binary
1. Replace **your_locale**, **your_format**, **your_guid** in accordance to your own application
2. Replace **your_access_token** with the JWT access token retrieved from [Step 1](#Step1)
3. Replace **your_wave_file** with the actual wave file
4. Run the command in **bash**

    `curl -v -X POST "https://speech.platform.bing.com/speech/recognition/interactive/cognitiveservices/v1?language=pt-BR&locale=your_locale&format=your_format&requestid=your_guid" -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token' -H 'Content-type: audio/wav; codec="audio/pcm"; samplerate=16000' --data-binary @your_wave_file`

5. Parse the Succcessful recognition response or Error response

## <a name="recognition-mode"></a>Recognition Mode  
You specify the *recognition mode* as part of the URL path for the Microsoft Speech Service. The following recognition modes are supported.  

| Mode | Path | URL Example |
|---- | ---- | ---- |
| Interactive/Command | /speech/recognition/interactive/cognitiveservices/v1 | https://speech.platform.bing.com/speech/recognition/interactive/cognitiveservices/v1?language=pt-BR |
| Conversation | /speech/recognition/conversation/cognitiveservices/v1 | https://speech.platform.bing.com/speech/recognition/conversation/cognitiveservices/v1?language=en-US |
| Dictation | /speech/recognition/dictation/cognitiveservices/v1 | https://speech.platform.bing.com/speech/recognition/dictation/cognitiveservices/v1?language=fr-FR |

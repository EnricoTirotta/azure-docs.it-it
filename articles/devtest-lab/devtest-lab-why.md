##<a name="overview"></a>Overview
DevTest Labs provides the following benefits in creating, configuring, and managing developer and test environments in the cloud

##<a name="worry-free-self-service"></a>Worry-free self-service

DevTest Labs makes it easier to control costs by allowing you to set policies on your lab - such as number of virtual machines (VM) per user and number of VMs per lab. DevTest Labs also enables you to create policies to automatically shut down and start VMs.

DevTest Labs enables you to create pre-provisioned environments with everything your team needs to start developing and testing applications. Simply claim the environments where the last good build of your application is installed and get working right away. Or, use containers for even faster and leaner environment creation.

##<a name="create-once,-use-everywhere"></a>Create once, use everywhere

Capture and share environment templates and artifacts within your team or organization - all in source control - to create developer and test environments easily.

##<a name="integrates-with-your-existing-toolchain"></a>Integrates with your existing toolchain

Leverage pre-made plug-ins or our API to provision Dev/Test environments directly from your preferred continuous integration (CI) tool, integrated development environment (IDE), or automated release pipeline. You can also use our comprehensive command-line tool.
